Sample application demonstrating how to do the most basic stuff in Spring LDAP.
A very simple dao implementation is provided in `org.springframework.ldap.samples.plain.dao.PersonRepositoryImpl`
It demonstrates some basic operations using Spring LDAP.

The core Spring application context of the sample is defined in `resources/applicationContext.xml`.
This application context will start an in-process Apache Directory Server instance, automatically populated
with some test data. The data will be reset every time the application is restarted.

To run the example, do `gradle jettyRun`, and then navigate to `http://localhost:8080/plain`
